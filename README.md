## Usage

The Note Frequency Generator is a simple website designed to generate a frequency in hertz for any given note in Western music theory.

## Context ðŸ“š

In Western music theory the pitch of every note (and therefore the frequency) is defined by three qualities: the note's octave, letter, and alter.

**The Octave** An octave is the distance between one pitch and another with is double it's frequency. Every octave is divided into 12 semitones.

**The Musical Alphabet** The Musical Alphabet "A B C D E F G" defines every note in an octave. 

**The Alter** The Alter represents the chromatic alteration of a note in semitones (e.g., -1 for flat, 1 for sharp)
